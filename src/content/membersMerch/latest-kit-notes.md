In addition to the existing shirts and vests, we also have new long-sleeve offerings in traditional neon orange and a new range in black.

The orange long-sleeve top is not available as a ladies fit, but it is still a good unisex option. Ladies may want to order one size smaller than usual for a better fit.

If you are unsure about sizing, please ask other runners or contact me via email or WhatsApp.

To help Ocho manage orders and reduce collections and deliveries, orders are currently processed monthly. There is no Horsell Runners stock held, everything is made to order.

If you place your order by the 17th of each month (or next working day when the 17th is a weekend or bank holiday), orders are processed, collected by me when ready, and handed out at the following Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday runs, usually around month end.
