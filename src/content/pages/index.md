Welcome to Horsell Runners, the informal social running club for those in and around Horsell and Woking who enjoy running! Established in Dec 2008 by Abigail Greaves as a way to exercise with other people in the area, it has since grown into a vibrant community of runners who share a passion for fitness and fun.

Our members often take part in events - local, national, and even international! We all support and encourage each other.

There's no membership, no formalities. We just run.

If you'd like to join us, see our list of meetups below and come along! We'd love to see you!
