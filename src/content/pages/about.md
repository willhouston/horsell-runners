## We Are Horsell Runners

Welcome to Horsell Runners, the informal social running club for those in and around Horsell and Woking who enjoy running! Established in Dec 2008 by Abigail Greaves as a way to exercise with other people in the area, it has since grown into a vibrant community of runners who share a passion for fitness and fun.

There are no joining fees or clubhouse requirements, and the club has grown purely through word of mouth. Our Wednesday evening runs, which are 4 - 6 miles in length, have become a regular fixture attracting a few dozen participants each week. The routes typically follow residential streets in winter but include Horsell Common and the Basingstoke Canal towpath in summer.

### Our Ethos

At Horsell Runners, we live by our motto of "Get fit and have some fun." We believe that the social aspect of the club is just as important as the exercise itself, which is why we encourage all our members to come along and enjoy the company of fellow runners. Many of our runners wear a specially designed orange club T-shirt, and a number of our members take part in local races and events such as the Surrey Half Marathon, the Twickenham Cabbage Patch 10, as well as marathons and endurance events.

### Wednesday Runs

Our Wednesday evening sessions remain the core of the club, and we have only cancelled twice when conditions were deemed unsafe due to icy weather. Some of our participants use these sessions as training for marathons and ultra-marathons, including the London Marathon, the Endure24 near Reading, and the gruelling 56-mile Comrades Marathon in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa.

### Come And Join Us!
Join us at Horsell Runners and become part of a friendly and welcoming community of runners who share a passion for getting fit and having fun!
