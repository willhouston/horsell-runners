The G3 series kicked off with classic January conditions: cold air, frozen fingers, and determined runners on the start line.

Despite the temperature, Horsell Runners turned out in force and put in a strong set of performances across the field. It was one of those mornings where everyone earned their finish, whether chasing a position, testing early-season form, or simply getting round strong.

Huge well done to everyone who represented the club and helped set the tone for the rest of the series.

If this one has inspired you, come along to upcoming club sessions and we will help you build toward the next race in the calendar.
