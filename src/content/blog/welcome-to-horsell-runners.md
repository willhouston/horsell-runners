There is something special about a group run where everyone knows your name. Horsell Runners began with a handful of neighbours who wanted a friendly reason to get outside midweek. Today we are a mix of new runners, walkers, and seasoned athletes who believe the best runs are the ones that end with a smile.

We meet outside the Beijing Restaurant in Horsell for easy-to-join sessions. Each run is designed to bring people together, not split them apart. We have regroup points, buddy-up options, and someone to make sure nobody is left behind.

If you are new to running, start with our Wednesday night sessions. If you love longer distances, Sundays are your chance to stretch out. And if coffee is your motivation, the Saturday Breakfast Club is calling.

Come along, say hello, and let us know your goals. We will help you build the run routine that fits your life.
