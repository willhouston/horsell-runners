Our 2024 Reindeer Run delivered exactly what we hoped for: festive kit, happy miles, and a big club turnout.

The route brought together runners of different paces for a social seasonal session, with plenty of encouragement and laughter along the way. The event is a reminder of what makes Horsell Runners special: we show up for each other, all year round.

Thank you to everyone who joined, helped organise, and brought festive energy to the morning.

From all of us, happy running over the holiday period.
