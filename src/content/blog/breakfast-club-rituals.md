Saturday mornings feel lighter when you have a plan. Our Breakfast Club run begins at 08:00 and offers a choice of routes, usually between four and eight miles. The pace stays social, the regroup points are frequent, and the highlight arrives when we reach the café.

The ritual is simple:

1. Show up, say hello, and choose your pace group.
2. Enjoy a steady loop around Horsell and the surrounding paths.
3. Celebrate with a hot drink and a little breakfast chatter.

If you are nervous about your first Saturday run, bring a friend or ask for a buddy. We will pair you up. The only requirement is a willingness to start the weekend with fresh air and friendly faces.
