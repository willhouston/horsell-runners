Dragonboat 2023 gave Horsell Runners a chance to swap trainers for paddles and take on a very different kind of race day.

The club team brought plenty of energy, teamwork, and good humour to every heat. It was a fantastic day out that showed how strong our community is beyond running sessions, with support from teammates and friends throughout.

Massive thanks to everyone who took part, cheered from the bank, and helped make the day such a success.

More events like this are exactly why we love being part of this club.
