January’s Breakfast Club headed out on tour to the Ash Ranges for a change of scenery and a brilliant winter route.

The group took on rolling terrain, crisp air, and a proper social long run atmosphere from start to finish. These on-tour mornings are always a great way to mix up the usual routine, get a few extra miles in, and catch up with clubmates in a different setting.

As ever, the run was followed by the best part of Breakfast Club: coffee, chat, and planning where we should tour next.

If you are thinking about joining a future on-tour run, keep an eye on the Saturday WhatsApp updates for route details and start logistics.
