If you are eyeing your first race, take a deep breath. You have already done the hardest part: showing up to training. Here are a few club-tested tips to keep your race day calm and fun.

## Keep it simple

Stick to the gear and fuel that you used in training. Race day is not the time for new shoes or a mystery energy gel.

## Warm up gently

Arrive early, walk for five minutes, and jog lightly. We like to add a few short strides to wake the legs up.

## Run your own pace

It is easy to start too fast when everyone around you is buzzing. Focus on your plan and your breathing.

## Celebrate your finish

Whether you walk, jog, or sprint the final stretch, you earned it. Let us know how it went and we will cheer you on for the next one.
