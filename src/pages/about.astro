        <h3>What to expect</h3>
        <p>
          Meet outside the Beijing Restaurant in Horsell and look for the orange
          streak. We introduce new faces, explain the route, and make sure everyone
          feels comfortable before we start.
        </p>
        <p>
          After each run, we make time for a chat. It is the best part of the club.
